Hi! Welcome to my website!


My name is George and my academic work is at the intersection of political economy and behavioural science. Here you can find my CV, Publications, Working papers, Teaching, and Policy.


My research primarily focuses on the foundations of democracy: how democratic institutions function, how citizens interact with them and how they can be improved. I look at the electoral cycle through four essential angles: i) the factors that affect citizens’ participation, ii) those that shape their preferences, iii) the effect of elections on policies and welfare, and iv) collective decision making when institutions fail.


While my individual papers focus on just one or two of these steps at a time, my research as a whole seeks to paint a fresh and articulated picture of how democracy works, from how voters think and act to the output of democratic processes.

Currently I am Research Fellow and Lecturer (Teaching) at the Department of Psychological & Behavioural Science of London School of Economics, a Senior Research Fellow (Hon.) at the Institute for Global Prosperity of UCL, and a Research Advisor at Gallup. In 2019, I co-founded a Greek SME specialising in evaluating and designing policies that promote welfare, the Ethos Lab – Centre for Governance and Sustainability Research.
