Hi! Welcome to my website!


My name is George, I am a Researcher and Lecturer at the Department of Psychological & Behavioural Science at the London School of Economics and a Research Advisor at Gallup. In 2019, I founded a company specialising in evaluating and designing policies, the Ethos Lab â€“ Centre for Governance and Sustainability Research

My research primarily focuses on what people think and subsequently do.

I use applied microeconometrics (quasi-experiments) and experimental methods to examine behavioural phenomena in politics and economics with large, naturally occurring data sets.
